## Briefly About Myself:
#### My goal is to learn how to be a good web developer. I am a baker by education, but due to illness (allergy) I cannot work for them. I enjoy learning new things and trying to apply it in my life. The more knowledge you have, the better you understand reality.
#### I also enjoy connecting with people and making new connections.

#### At the moment I work as a watchman, it gives me the opportunity to learn, I believe that with my perseverance and hard work I will succeed!

### Kata Description:
Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

    return x.split(' ').join('')
}

```
## Kata Description:
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.
```
var stringToNumber = function(str){
    return Number(str);
}
```
