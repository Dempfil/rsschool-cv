## Briefly About Myself:
#### My goal is to learn how to be a good web developer. I am a baker by education, but due to illness (allergy) I cannot work for them. I enjoy learning new things and trying to apply it in my life. The more knowledge you have, the better you understand reality.
#### I also enjoy connecting with people and making new connections.

#### At the moment I work as a watchman, it gives me the opportunity to learn, I believe that with my perseverance and hard work I will succeed!
